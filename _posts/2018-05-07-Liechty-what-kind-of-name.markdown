Just an initial test post, but in case you were wondering where the name Liechty comes from, the Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia
has an [answer][liechty-last-name].  And like the site says, my Liechty ancestors were Mennonites from Landiswil, Switzerland.  When they
emigrated to the US, they kept heading west to join a small Mennonite community in the Willamette Valley in Oregon in the 1880s.  

I, however, grew up in Southern California knowing nothing of farms or horses.
