I'm a computer programmer.  Most of my work has been in bioinformatics and scientific computing.

As an undergraduate I obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in [Biological Sciences][uci-bio-sci] 
from the University of California, Irvine.

I then worked for 9 years doing benchwork molecular and cell biology in a commercial biotechnology setting in the Bay Area.

We moved to Austin, Texas in 1997 when my spouse was hired to a faculty position at University of Texas, Austin.
Later, I was admitted to the [Computer Science program][txstate-cs-dept] at Texas State University, San Marcos and I graduated 
from there with a Master of Science degree in Computer Science (with a minor in Mathematics) in 2002.

In 2003 my spouse began her current position  at the University of California, Davis, bringing us back to California.

In my previous job, from 2007 to 2015, I worked at the University of California, Davis in their [Department of Plant Sciences][ucd-ps] as 
a bioinformatics programmer.

You can view publications I've collaborated on on my [Google Scholar page][google-scholar-page].
